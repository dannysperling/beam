To build the projects in eclipse, open a workspace in the main repository folder (containing beam, beam-android and beam-desktop). From here, you can add the projects through File/Import..., Geneal/Existing Projects into Workspace.

For testing purposes, the main method is located in class main in beam-android. Running it as a java application will run the game.

Art assets are presently located in the CS 4152/All Art/Art Assets on drive. In order to run the project, copy these assets into beam-android/assets/data. The folder is linked to beam-desktop, so assets do not need to be explicitly added to the desktop project.

### Game Details ###

At present the game is mostly a framework. To test input, output is currently printed of the current location of any mouse press.
